# Dava Skin Swither

## INSTALLATION ON PC

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The guide below is for manual installation, which is not recommended. I strongly recommend using the installer. If it does not work or if you cannot fix errors preventing it from running, install manually.

### LESTA

1. Or extract the required archive to a convenient location.
2. Place the files in `\Tanks_Blitz\Data\` with replacement.
3. Place the files in `\Documents\TanksBlitz\packs\` if Smart DLC is active in the game.

### WG

1. Or extract the required archive to a convenient location.
2. Place the files in `\World_of_Tanks_Blitz\Data\` with replacement.
3. Place the files in `%localappdata%\wotblitz\packs` if Smart DLC is active in the game.
   - To find the folder, press WIN+R and enter the command: `%localappdata%\wotblitz\packs`
