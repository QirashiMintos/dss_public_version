## INSTALLATION ON ANDROID

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The guide below is for installation on Android. In some cases, the mod needs to be integrated into the APK file and also placed in the cache. If Smart DLC is active, it is sufficient to simply place the files in the cache.

### Installation of the Modification

1. **Integrating into APK**:
   - If you need to integrate the mod into the APK file, use specialized tools such as APKTool or similar programs.
   - Open the APK file using the chosen tool and add the necessary mod files to the appropriate directories inside the APK.
   - After making changes, rebuild the APK file and sign it (this is usually done automatically by the tool).

2. **Placing in Cache**:
   - If your mod does not require integration into the APK, or if you have already integrated the mod into the APK, the next step is to place the files in the cache.
   - Move the mod files to the game's cache folder. This is typically located at: `\Android\data\com.wargaming.wot.blitz\` or `\Android\data\com.tanksblitz.ru\`.
   - If you have Smart DLC activated, it is sufficient to simply place the files in the cache, and they will be correctly loaded by the game.

### Additional Instructions

- **Checking Functionality**:
  - After completing the installation, launch the game and check if the mod works correctly.
  - If the mod does not function properly, verify the correctness of the steps performed and check for conflicts with other installed modifications.

### Errors and Issues

If you encounter problems during installation or use of the mod:

1. Ensure that all files have been correctly installed/placed.
2. Check for conflicts with other modifications.
3. In case of errors, contact the support community or create an issue in this repository.
